## WRITING SEQUENCES
Language is ever-evolving, adapting to the needs of its speakers over time. Even people who speak the same language will speak (and write) in a variation that is often shared by the people culturally similar to and/or geographically close to each other – in other words, a dialect (Wolfram & Schilling-Estes, 2016).  

Given that “to speak a language is to speak some dialect of that language” (Wolfram & Schilling-Estes, 2016, p. 2), that each of these dialects is rule-governed (Rickford, 1999; Wolfram et al., 1999), and that purpose of writing is to express oneself and to communicate with others, we align our work with the Committee on College Composition and Communication’s (CCCC) resolution that all “students have a right to their own patterns and varieties of language -- the dialects of their nurture or whatever dialects in which they find their own identity and style” (CCCC, 1974, p. 2).  

Since we also “view variety of dialects as an advantage” (CCCC, 1974, p. 8), we have purposefully chosen not to penalize students’ use of dialect as errors in our scoring when that use does not correspond to “typical” or edited, mainstream American English (hereafter referred to as mainstream American English; MAE). 

In this manual, a writing sequence is defined as the connection from one written UNIT to the next (i.e., adjacent writing units). Adjacent writing units could be two words or it could be a word and a punctuation mark.  

## CORRECT SEQUENCES
Marking a correct writing sequence indicates that BOTH adjacent writing units correctly utilize spelling, punctuation, grammar, syntax, and capitalization per the rules of the writer’s dialect (more on this later). This manual uses a red carat (^) to designate correct writing sequences.  

Carats have been added to the example sentences below to demonstrate the scoring of correct writing sequences. In both of these example, each sequence is correct because each word is spelled correctly, the syntax and grammar features are correct for the student’s dialect, words are appropriately capitalized, and end punctuation is used appropriately.  
> **MAE1: ^I ^think ^the ^author ^cares ^about ^what ^his ^family ^thinks ^about ^him^. ^He ^wants ^to ^make ^his ^family ^happy^.** 

> **NMAE2: ^I ^think ^the ^author ^care ^about ^what ^his ^family ^be ^thinking ^about ^him^. ^He ^want ^to ^make ^his ^family ^happy^.** 
In the above examples, note that correct sequences are marked between every word and marked before and after each punctuation mark (except at the end of the passage, when there is no next unit).  

When errors in spelling, punctuation, grammar, syntax, or capitalization are made, the sequence is marked as incorrect.  

## INCORRECT SEQUENCES
Every writing sequence (i.e., adjacent writing units) should receive a marking. The marking indicates if that sequence is correct or incorrect, according to the rules of the writer’s dialect (more on this in the next section). This manual uses Ⓦ to designate incorrect word-level sequences and Ⓢ to designate sentence-level sequences. Word-level errors include incorrect uses of capitalization and spelling. Sentence-level errors include incorrect uses of punctuation, semantics, and syntax, per the writer’s dialect.

 
|**Word-Level Errors** |  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ![missing capital](images/incorrectSequenceTable1.png) |Mark before the word for: <ul><li>a proper name  </li><li>the beginning of a sentence</li><li>the word “I”    </li></ul>|
| ![mispelled word](images/mispelledWord.png)     |Misspellings include: <ul><li>general misspellings   </li><li>incorrect homophone  </li><li>combining two words</li><li>incorrect apostrophe usage/lack thereof   </li></ul>|
| ![single incorrect sequence](images/singleIncorrectSequence.png)     | Use this button when there is already another type of error marked at the beginning of the word.   |
|**Sentence-Level Errors** ||
| ![missing punctuation](images/missingPunctuation.png)      | Missing punctuation (mark the sequence before the punctuation). <br><br> Commas are only required:  <ul><li>when introducing a direct quote </li><li>in a series (Oxford not required)  </li><li>after an introductory phrase/clause (not transition words) </li></ul> |

| ![subject verb/ noun modifier agreement](images/subjectVerb-noundModifierAgreement.png)   |Use this to mark verbs that do not agree with their subject and to mark nouns that do not agree with their modifiers |  

The specific rules for each of these areas are detailed in each section below. 

## WORD-LEVEL ACCURACY
Accuracy at the word-level measures errors that involve incorrect uses of capitalization and spelling, accounting for dialect variations that may affect spelling. See the examples below and Appendix A for more explanation.  

Word-level errors are marked by this symbol, Ⓦ, an encircled capital W. A capitalization error is marked with a blue encircled capital W, Ⓦ,and a spelling error is marked with a purple encircled capital W, Ⓦ. 
##### CAPITALIZATION
Mark an incorrect sequence BEFORE a word that should be capitalized but is not.  
* A correct sequence can be marked after the word if it is spelled correctly, and the next adjacent unit is also correct.  
> **… thinks ^about ^him^. Ⓦhe ^wants ^to ^make**
* Capitalization is required in <u>only</u> these instances: 
1. the beginning of a sentence or a quotation,  
1. a proper noun,    
1. the word “I”. Please note that the capitalization error is marked before the word I and not after the word I. 
1. If there is a title, the student should capitalize the first word of the title. 
* Ignore capitalization within the sentence. In other words, if a word is capitalized when it is not necessary (e.g, not a proper noun), if a whole word is capitalized, or if the student writes in all capitals, do not mark it as incorrect. 
> **Ⓦthe ^fire ^drill ^is ^ALL ^ABOut ^being ^safe^.**
> **^YOU ^CAN ^GET ^LOST ^IN ^THE ^WILD^.**
**Note**: There are many other capitalization rules. However, errors associated with those capitalization rules are less likely to influence the quality of a written work and will not be counted as errors for the purposes of this assessment.  
##### SPELLING
An incorrect sequence is marked on both sides of a word that is spelled incorrectly, <u>taking into consideration the student’s dialect</u>. Typically, the following conditions are considering spelling errors (though coders should always consider dialectical context first): 
* The word is spelled incorrectly for the context of the sentence (e.g., homophones).  
> **^Mom ^and ^the ^boy ^will ^ride ⓌthereⓌ bikes^.** 
* The student combines two words into one.  
> **^It ^also ^will ^take ⓌalotⓌ of ^cleaning^.** 
* The student splits a word (including compound words) into two separate words.  
> **^at ^the ^park ^on ^the ^side Ⓦwalk^.**  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the first part of the mis-split word is incorrectly spelled, mark it as incorrect.Otherwise, mark it correct:  
> **^It ^was ^a Ⓦdiss Ⓦgrace ^when ^she**  
> **^It ^was ^a ^dis Ⓦgrace ^when ^she** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the second part of the mis-split word is incorrectly spelled, mark it as incorrect after the word. Otherwise, mark it correct:  

Differences in students’ dialects may impact their spelling. The following would be acceptable spelling variations that are due to common, rule-governed dialect features: 
* Consonant cluster reductions  
> **^He ^ran ^so ^fas ^no ^one ^could ^catch ^him^.**  
> **^I ^like ^that ^dog ^since ^she ^is ^frienly^.** 
* Voiced and unvoiced th variations 
> **^Jump ^rope ^is ^a ^way ^to ^stay ^healfy^.**  
> **^Dis ^is ^my ^bike^.**   

There are a few other spelling guidelines to keep in mind: 
* Assume all proper names are spelled correctly. 
* Correct abbreviations are acceptable. 
* Due to the timed nature of this task, do not mark an incorrect or correct sequence after the final sequence. The student may not have had time to complete a word or to add punctuation at the end of a sentence.  
> **^Susan ^hopes ^they ^will co** 
## SENTENCE-LEVEL ACCURACY
Accuracy at the sentence-level measures errors that involve incorrect uses of punctuation, syntax, and semantics, accounting for dialect variations (especially in the area of syntax). See the examples below and Appendix A for more explanation.  

Sentence-level errors are marked by this symbol, Ⓢ, an encircled capital S. A punctuation error is marked with a red encircled capital S, Ⓢ, a syntax error is marked with a green encircled capital S,Ⓢ, and a semantics error is marked with a yellow encircled capital S, Ⓢ. 
##### PUNCTUATION
Correct punctuation receives two correct marks (one on either side of the punctuation mark). In order for both marks to be correct, there needs to be a correctly spelled word, followed by correct punctuation, followed by a capital letter beginning the first word of the next sentence.  

The end of a sentence should be scored with a mark between the last word and the punctuation AND between the punctuation and the beginning of the next sentence. Therefore, missing punctuation requires two incorrect marks.  
> **^At ^the ^gas ^station^, ^Tony ^told ^Sam ^to ^give ^the ^money ^to ^the ^gas ^station ^owner^. Ⓦit ^took ^a ^15 ^second ^wait ^just ^to ^give ^the ^money^. ^After ^thatⓈⓈ the ^owner ^gave ^back ^the ^changeⓈⓈTony ^was ^waiting ^outside ^for ^Sam ^to ^come ^back ^out ^to ^pump ⓈupⓈ the ^gas^.**

The following rules apply for commas:  
* Missing commas should have two incorrect marks for clear instances of a need for a comma or other punctuation. Commas are <u>ONLY required</u> in 3 situations: 
    * Introducing a direct quotation
    > **^Brandon ^was ^so ^happy ^that ^he ^had ^a ^big ^smile ^on ^his ^face ^and ^said^,^"^Thank ^you ^for ^finding ^him ^John^!^"**

    * In a series  
        * The CCSS has not specifically stated whether Oxford commas are necessary, so both of the following examples are correct uses of commas in a series: 
    > **^It ^will ^make ^people ^sick^, ^cough^ or^ itch^.**   
    > **^It ^will ^make ^people ^sick^, ^cough^,^ or^ itch^.** 
    * After an indtroductory phrase of clause
    > **^When ^the ^bell ^arrived^, ^the ^bell ^was ^tested**
* The comma rule does NOT apply to transition words: 
> **^Also ^we^ can ^ride**  

* When numbers are used, mark correct sequences when commas are used correctly or not used at all. Only mark incorrect sequences if the commas are misused. 
> **^Maldives ^has ^a ^population ^of ^340000^.**  
> **^Maldives ^has ^a ^population ^of Ⓢ3400,00Ⓢ.** 

Place correct or incorrect marks between all adjacent punctuation. For example, use two incorrect marks when a comma is missing prior to quotations (one incorrect mark for the sequence from the word to the comma and one incorrect mark from the comma to the quotation mark).  
> **^The ^second ^quote ⓈⓈ"^Opportunity ^is ^missed ^by ^most ^people ^because ^it ^is ^dressed ^in ^overalls ^and ^looks ^like ^work^" ^is ^explaining ^that**    
If the comma is incorrectly placed in relation to the quotation marks, mark the comma as incorrect. 
> **^“^I ^wrote ^the ^story^”Ⓢ, Ⓢshe ^said^.**    
There are multiple other punctuation rules and guidelines to keep in mind: 
* If commas or any other extraneous mark of punctuation are inserted incorrectly, mark incorrect writing sequences around the punctuation (use the ‘Incorrect Punctuation’ button), as that will create the marks around the word or punctuation instead of 2 marks together, like when it is missing: 
    > **^The ^article ^tells ^you ^what ^plants ^are ^good ^to ^have ^in ^FloridaⓈ,Ⓢ and ^what^ plants ^are ^bad ^to ^have ^in ^Florida^.**  

    > **Ⓢ]Ⓢ I ^would ^sculpt Ⓦmikey Ⓦmouse ^because ^he ^looks ^easy ^and ^fun^.**

    * If a student writes a sentence fragment (defined as a sentence that is missing a verb and/or a subject), use the fewest incorrect sequence marks to correct the sentence (if possible).Combining fragment with previous sentence with comma:  
        > **^Well ^it ^was ⓌobviusⓌ that ^they ^could ^cause ^like ^Andics ^saidⓈⓈ "^DogsⓈⓈ brains ^care ^about ^both ^what ^we ^we ^say ^and ^how ^we ^say ^itⓈ"Ⓢ. Like ^sit ^or ^stay ^or ^lay ^down ^or ^roll ^over^.**    


* If quotation marks, colons, semicolons, ellipses, parentheses, or dashes are used correctly, mark correct sequences on both sides of the punctuation. Only mark incorrect sequences if these punctuation marks are clearly misused or if their absence creates a sentence fragment.   
    > **^just ^three ^natural ^ingredients Ⓢ ; Ⓢmycelium ^(^the ^vegetative ^part ^of ^mushrooms^)^, ^hemp^, ^and ^salt^.**
* Apostrophes are marked with an incorrect sequence on <u>both sides of the word</u>. This applies when an apostrophe is missing or when an apostrophe is incorrectly added.  
    > **^so ^you ⓈwontⓈ get ^a ⓌcaviteyⓌ.**   
    > **I Ⓢwen'tⓈ back ^to ^the ^waterpark^.** 
* Hyphens – ignore them. If a missing hyphen creates a word that can’t stand alone, score it as incorrectly split.  
    > **^A ^seven-^year-^old ^boy ^joined ^the ^Navy^.**   
    > **^A ^seven ^year-^old ^boy ^joined ^the ^Navy^.**   
    > **^A ^7-^year-^old ^boy ^joined ^the^ Navy^.**  
    > **^Using ^the ^post-test ^data**   
    > **^despite ^the ^almost ^non Ⓢlivable ^conditions^.**  
* Incorrect spacing around punctuation is okay and correct sequences should be used. In other words, spacing does not affect scoring 

* For run-on sentences determine where a logical break should be located and mark TWO incorrect sequences in that location.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some will have multiple run-ons. After identifying the first run on, the next determination of a run-on should   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be based on assuming the previous mistake was corrected.       
    > **^This ^story^ is ^about ^a ^girl ^name ⓌarielleⓈⓈ that ^she ^was ^going ^fishing ^with ^her ^dad ^and ^her ^brother Ⓦjeoy ^and Ⓦarielle ^did ^not ^want ^to ^go ^fishing ⓈⓈshe ^was ^going ^to ^the ^mall ^but ^her ^mom ⓌcoughtⓌ a ^cold ⓈⓈ now ^she ^has ^to ^go ⓌfichingⓌ.^Then ^she ^got ^her ^stuff**    
    > **^I ^would ^try ^to ^stay ^healthy ^by ^eating ^two ^cups ^of ^fruit ^each ^day ⓈⓈ and ^I ^would ^try ^to ⓌlimiteⓌ my ^eating ^of ^sugar ^because ^I ^have ^to ^stay ^healthy ^to ^keep ^in ^sports ⓈⓈ and ^I ^would ^try ^to ^eat ^five ^to ^six ^ounces ^of ^meat ^and ^try ^not ^to ^stay ^inside**  

##### SYNTAX
Mark two incorrect sequences when a word is missing, words are transposed, or there is an extra word or phrase.   
    > **^Dogs ^are ⓈtheⓈ one ^of ^the ^most ⓈⓈ mamalⓌ that**  
    > **^They ^would ^have ^to ^evacuate ^quickly ^before ^the ^lava ^could ^hit ^them Ⓢcould ^hit ^themⓈ or ^damage ^their ^cars^.**   

* Note: we are NOT looking for consistent verb tense within a sentence: 
    > **^The ^boy’s ^mom ⓌwontsⓌ a ^new ^bike ^so ^they ^go ^to ^the ^bike ^store ^and ^she Ⓦpast Ⓦher ^bike ^lesson ⓈⓈand ^she ^tried ^bikes ^and ^she ^found ^the ⓌriteⓌ one**    

##### DIALECT INFLUENCE ON SYNTAX 
Differences in students’ dialects may impact their syntax in other ways that are NOT indicative of potential language disorders, and thus will be <u>marked as correct</u>. The following would be <u>acceptable syntactical variations</u> that are due to common, rule-governed dialect features: 
* Variable use of <u>copula *be*</u> = Copula be is variably, but systematically, omitted (copula be = a “linking” verb; the main verb, as opposed to auxiliary be = the “helping” verb to a main verb)  
    > **^They ^hungry^.**
    > **^He ^funny^.**   
* Use of -s as regular third-person present tense marker is not required 
    > **^The ^author ^like ^the ^cell ^phone ^because ^you ^can ^use ^it ^for ^many ^things^.**   
    > **^She ^talk ^a ^lot^.**  
* Use of -ed as regular past tense marker is not required
    > **^Last ^time^, ^she ^cook ^my ^breakfast^.**    
* Use of ain’t in place of have + not, are + not, or do + not 
    > **^They ^ain’t ^coming^.**
* Absence of auxiliary *do*
    > **^You ^have ^a ^dog^?**
    > **^How ^you ^get ^up ^there^?**
* Multiple negation 
    > **^He ^didn’t ^want ^no ^one ^to ^help ^him^.**
* Absence of possessive *‘s* 
    > **^We ^went ^to ^his ^mom ^house ^last ^night^.**

##### EXCEPTIONS  
There are a few dialect-specific syntactical features that have been shown in research to be clinical indicators of potential language disorders (for a review, see Lee-James & Johnson, 2022; see also Garrity & Oetting, 2010; Oetting & McDonald, 2001; Oetting & Newkirk, 2008).  

We will be coding only these dialect-specific features as “errors,” acknowledging that they are acceptable uses of language within the dialect, but are also useful in helping practitioners to recognize if a student may need further language evaluation. 

1. **Irregular past tense** = Instances where present tense of irregular verb is used for past (e.g., eat for ate) or different past tense from MAE is used (e.g., seen for saw, brung for brought) (Oetting & McDonald, 2001)
    > **^When ^he ⓈfallⓈ down ^the ^stairs ^yesterday^, ^he ^got ^hurt^.** 
    > **^I ⓈbrungⓈ the ^book ^back ^to ^the ^library^.**
2. **Irregular third person** = Instances where present tense of verbs have, do, go, say is used for irregular third person (e.g., she have for she has, he do for he does, it go for it goes) (Oetting & Mcdonald, 2001)
    > **^They ⓈhasⓈ to ^go ^on ^the ^nature ^walk^.**
    >**^She ⓈdoⓈ her ^chores ^when ^she ^is ^told^.**
3. **Non-inversion of WH- questions** = Instances where a WH- question is asked without inverting the auxiliary verb (e.g., why I can’t play for why can’t I play) (Oetting & Mcdonald, 2001)]
    > **^What ⓈthisⓈ is^?**
    > **^Why ^he Ⓢcan’tⓈ come^?**
4. **Auxiliary am, is, and are** = Instances where auxiliary verbs am, is, are (i.e., when they are the “helping,” not “main” verb) are:
* omitted (e.g., they running for they are running – where running is the main verb), 
* used in a dialect-appropriate way (e.g., they is doing for they are doing)  
* or used in a dialect-inappropriate way (e.g., he am running for he is running/he running) (Garrity & Oetting, 2010) 
    > **^I ⓈⓈworking ^on ^my ^homework ^at ^the ^table^.**
    > **^It ⓈⓈgoing ^to ^be ^hot ^today^.**
    > **^They ⓈisⓈ cutting ^the ^tree ^down^.**
    > **^He ⓈareⓈ reading ^that ^book^.**  
5. **Subject relatives that, who, and which** = Instances where a subject relative pronoun (that, who, which) is absent (e.g., that’s the man came here for that’s the man who came here) (Oetting & Newkirk, 2008)  
    > **^I ^have ^a ^cousin ⓈⓈ has ^a ^rabbit^.**
    > **^I ^eat ^hot ^chips ⓈwhatⓈ make ^my ^mouth ^be ^on ^fire^.**
6. **Articles the, a, & an** = Instances where article is absent or definite article (the) is used in place of indefinite article (a/an) or vice versa (de Villiers et al., 2000)
    > **^Now ⓈⓈcar ^is ^parked^.**
    > **^I ^need ⓈtheⓈ nap^.**

##### SEMANTICS
* Mark incorrect sequences around a word that may be correctly spelled and the appropriate part of speech, but does not fit the meaning of the sentence.  
    > **^The ^person ^who ^was ^the ⓈheadlineⓈ of ^the ^job ^did ^not ^like ^people ⓈthatⓈ were** 

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
* You will likely never have more than 2 incorrect sequences next to each other. If there is ever a case to be made for 3 in a row, bring it up to the group for discussion.
* In cases where there are technically multiple ways to classify an incorrect writing sequence due to both units being incorrect (e.g. a misspelled word next to an incorrect use of punctuation), the scorer should choose one type of error and NOT include multiple different markings. (The scoring software should not allow this mistake of multiple error markings, but it is important to keep in mind for general theory and scoring by hand.)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the below example, the sequence between the comma and “andd" is incorrect <u>both</u> because the comma 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insertion is incorrect and “andd” is spelled incorrectly. Score it so that the first error in chronological order 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;takes precedence. 
    > **^It ^tells ^you ^what ^plants ^are ^good ^to ^have ^in ^FloridaⓈ, ⓈanddⓌ what^ plants ^are ^bad ^to ^have ^in ^Florida^.**  
    > Nonexample: **^It ^tells ^you ^what ^plants ^are ^good ^to ^have ^in ^FloridaⓈ, ⓌanddⓌ what^ plants ^are ^bad ^to ^have ^in ^Florida^**  
* With sentence fragments such as the one below, there may be more than one error in the highlighted sequence (_) (e.g. missing multiple words, misspellings, etc. in order to form a complete sentence).
    > **no becuse_bitin or pozend by a animmol**
    > **no becuseⓈⓈbitin or pozend by a animmol**

* When a student talks like they speak, these words should be marked as correct.  
    * Examples are inserting the word *“like”* or using slang, such as *“kinda”*    
    * This also applies to using “cause” in place of “because” (however, misspellings such as “cuz” would still be marked incorrect)
        > **^She ^said ^she ^wants ^a ^job ^cause ^she ^needs ^more ^money^.**   
    * Use of *finna/fitna, sposeta,* or *bouta* as contractions for *fixing to, supposed to*, or *about to*    
        > **^We ^are ^finna ^leave ^soon^.**  
        > **^They ^are ^sposeta ^be ^in ^class^.** 
* A sequence should be marked before the very first word of a paragraph.  
    * Example at the beginning:      
    > **^The ^increase ^in ^tourism…**
    * Example in the middle:   
    > **…after ^attracting ^them ^over^.**   
    > **^A ^spider ^that ^is ^alike…**
* If the student uses a title  
    > **^Ants ^and ^Their ^Amazing ^Talents**   
    > **^In ^Poland ^there ^are ^many ^ants…**
* How do you score the last word the student wrote? Never mark a sequence (correct or incorrect) after the last thing that the student wrote. If the student was in the middle of typing a word, ignore that last word. If they completed the word or have punctuation marked, score the sequence before the word/punctuation, but not after.   
    > **^I ^would ^eat ^all ^of ^the ^healthy ^things ^that ^could ^keep^ me he**   
    > **^Broiled ^meat ^or ^grilled ^can ^give ^you n**   
    > **^I ^would ^eat ^all ^of ^the ^healthy ^things^.**
* Numerals are acceptable and marked as correct as long as they are used correctly. 
    > **^There ^were ^3 ^cars ^in ^the ^parking ^lot^.**
* Case - In the following example, the word should be myself rather than me. However, we are not marking incorrect sequences for problems with case. 
    > **^Laws ^help ^me ^and ^other ^people ^keep ^safe^.**
* Symbols and abbreviations - if the symbol or abbreviation is used correctly it should be marked as correct.  
    > **^&^** 
    > **^T.V.^   or  ^TV^** 
    > **^I ^like ^dogs ^etc^.**
* If punctuation is missing, mark the missing punctuation, but do NOT also penalize for missing capital letter.  
    > **^stay ^healthy ^to ^keep ^in ^sports ⓈⓈ and ^he ^would ^try ^to ^eat ^five ^to ^six ^ounces ^of ^meat**
* If the student including ‘planning’ notes in their essay; score it like connected words.  
    > **^(^introduction^) @consequences ^of ^increased ^tourism ^at ^national ^parks^.**   
    > **^(^paragraphP@ increased ^tourism ^has^ caused ^a ^lot ^of ^chaos^.**
## LIMITATIONS
A writing sequence only considers the correctness between adjacent written units; it does not always reflect grammatical issues at the paragraph level and sometimes misses grammatical issues at the sentence level. For example, it will not reflect shifts in verb tense or voice from sentence to sentence. At the sentence level, it is also sometimes very difficult to determine where a long run-on sentence should end, or if there are multiple places to mark insertion of end punctuation. Furthermore, it does not capture errors regarding parallel construction at the sentence or paragraph level.   

At first, scoring of CIWS is time-consuming due to the many rules. After some practice with the scoring, the average time to score CIWS is less than 5 minutes. There may be some situations that do not fit the rules listed above, and it may be difficult to determine whether correct or incorrect sequences should be marked. Since writing has an infinite number of possible responses, difficult-to-score situations are highly likely. In these situations 

1 – Score the writing using your best judgment  

2 – Copy the sentence or the entire writing sample in the FAQs document on Dropbox. 

3 – Include the student ID number & prompt name  
## ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES
Several practice examples are provided here. A Florida student wrote each example below in response to the writing prompts in the open response diagnostic assessment of the FAIR-FS. The scoring is demonstrated below each example, based on the dialect of the writer. The calculation of CIWS for each individual example is also provided.
