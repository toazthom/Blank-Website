# Correct Writing Sequences
A sequence is defined as the connection from one written UNIT to the next (i.e., adjacent writing units). Adjacent writing units could be two words or it could be a word and a punctuation mark. 

Marking a correct writing sequence indicates that BOTH adjacent writing units correctly utilize spelling, punctuation, grammar, syntax, and capitalization. This manual uses a carat (**^**) to designate correct writing sequences. Carats have been added to the two example sentences below to demonstrate the scoring of correct writing sequences.

>**^I ^think ^the ^author ^cares ^about ^what ^his ^family ^thinks ^about ^him^. ^He ^wants ^to ^make ^his ^family ^happy^.**

In the above example, note that correct sequences are marked between every word and marked before and after each punctuation mark. In this example each sequence is considered to be correct because each word is correctly spelled, the syntax and grammar features are correct, words are appropriately capitalized, and end punctuation is used appropriately. 

When errors in spelling, punctuation, grammar, syntax, or capitalization are made, the sequence is marked as incorrect. 

# Incorrect Writing Sequences
Every writing sequence (i.e., adjacent writing units) should receive a marking. The marking indicates if that particular sequence is correct or incorrect. This manual uses the letter (**X**) to designate incorrect writing sequences. Incorrect writing sequences are marked if the unit on EITHER side of a sequence violates a rule of spelling, syntax, grammar, punctuation, or capitalization. The specific rules for each of these areas is detailed below. 

## Spelling
An incorrect sequence is marked on both sides of a word that is spelled incorrectly.

- The word is spelled incorrectly for the context of the sentence. 

    >**^Mom ^and ^the ^boy ^will ^ride XthereX bikes^.**

- The student combines two words into one. 

    >**^It ^also ^will ^take XalotX of ^cleaning^.**

- The student split one word into two separate words.
 
    >**^ at ^the ^park ^on ^the ^sideX walk^.**
    >
    >**^It ^was ^a Xdiss Xgrace ^when ^she**

- Assume all proper names of people are spelled correctly.
- Correct abbreviations are acceptable.
- Due to the timed nature of this task, do not mark an incorrect or correct sequence at the end. The student may not have had time to complete a word or to add punctuation at the end of a sentence.

    >**^Susan ^hopes ^they ^will co**

## Punctuation
The end of a sentence should be scored with a mark between the last word and the punctuation AND between the punctuation and the beginning of the next sentence. Correct punctuation receives two correct marks (one on either side of the punctuation mark). Therefore, missing punctuation requires two incorrect marks. In order for both marks to be correct, there needs to be a correctly spelled word, followed by correct punctuation, followed by a capital letter beginning the first word of the next sentence. 

>**^At ^the ^gas ^station^, ^Tony ^told ^Sam ^to ^give ^the ^money^to ^the ^gas ^station ^owner^. Xit ^took ^a ^15 ^second ^wait ^just ^to ^give ^the ^money^. ^After ^thatXX the ^owner ^gave ^back ^the ^changeXXTony ^was ^waiting ^outside ^for ^Sam ^to ^come ^back ^out ^to ^pump XupX the ^gas^.**

Other uses of punctuation should be scored as follows:

- Place correct or incorrect marks between all adjacent punctuation. For example, use two incorrect marks when a comma is missing prior to quotations (one incorrect mark for the sequence from the word to the comma and one incorrect mark from the comma to the quotation mark). 

    >**^The ^second ^quote XX "^Opportunity ^is ^missed ^by ^most ^people ^because ^it ^is ^dressed ^in ^overalls ^and ^looks ^like ^work^"^ is ^explaining^that**

- If the comma is incorrectly placed in relation to the quotation marks, mark the comma as incorrect.

    >**^“^I ^wrote ^the ^story^”X, Xshe ^said^.**

* Missing commas should have two incorrect marks for clear instances of a need for a comma or other punctuation. Commas are ONLY required in 3 situations:
  - introducing a direct quotation
   - in a series
     + The CCSS has not specifically stated whether Oxford commas are necessary, so both of the following examples are correct uses of commas in a series:
        >Example: **^It ^will ^make ^people ^sick^, ^cough ^or ^itch^.**
        >
        >Example: **^It ^will ^make ^people ^sick^, ^cough^, ^or ^itch^.**
    
  - after an introductory phrase or clause

- The comma rule does NOT apply to transition words.

    >Example: **^Also ^we^ can \^ride** 

- If commas or any other extraneous mark of punctuation are inserted incorrectly, mark incorrect writing sequences around the comma

    >Example: **^The ^article ^tells ^you ^what ^plants ^are ^good ^to ^have ^in ^Florida X, Xand ^what ^plants ^are ^bad ^to ^have ^in ^Florida^.**

- When numbers are used, mark correct sequences when commas are used correctly or not used at all. Only mark incorrect sequences if the commas are misused.

    >Example: **^Maldives ^has ^a ^population ^of ^340000^.**
    >
    >Example: **^Maldives ^has ^a ^population ^of X3400,00 X.**
- Apostrophes are marked with an incorrect sequence on both sides of the **word**. This applies when an apostrophe is missing or when an apostrophe is incorrectly added.

  >**^so ^you XwontX get ^a XcaviteyX.**
  >
  >**^I Xwen'tX back ^to ^the ^waterpark^.**

- If quotation marks, colons, semicolons, ellipses, parentheses, or dashes are used correctly, mark correct sequences on both sides of the punctuation. Only mark incorrect sequences if these punctuation marks are clearly misused or if their absence creates a sentence fragment. 

  >Example: **^just ^three ^natural ^ingredients X ; Xmycelium ^(^the ^vegetative ^part ^of ^mushrooms^)^, ^hemp^, ^and ^salt^.**
 
- Hyphens – ignore them. If a missing hyphen creates a word that can’t stand alone, score it as incorrectly split. 

  >**^A ^seven-^year-^old ^boy ^joined ^the ^Navy^.**
  >
  >**^A ^seven ^year-^old ^boy ^joined ^the ^Navy^.**
  >
  >**^A ^7-^year-^old ^boy ^joined ^the ^Navy^.**
  >
  >**^Using ^the ^post-test \^data**
  >
  >**^despite ^the ^almost ^non Xlivable ^conditions^.**

- Incorrect spacing around punctuation is ok and correct sequences should be used. In other words, spacing does not affect scoring.

- For any errors where the incorrect punctuation is used, use the ‘missing punctuation’ button.

- For run-on sentences determine where a logical break should be located and mark TWO incorrect sequences in that location.

- Some will have multiple run-ons. After identifying the first run on, the next determination of a run-on should be based on assuming the previous mistake was corrected. 

  >For example: **^This ^story ^is ^about ^a ^girl Xname XarielleXX that ^she ^was ^going ^fishing ^with ^her ^dad ^and ^her ^brother Xjeoy ^and Xarielle ^did ^not ^want ^to ^go ^fishing XXshe ^was ^going ^to ^the ^mall ^but ^her ^mom XcoughtX a ^cold XX now ^she ^has ^to ^go XfichingX.^Then ^she ^got ^her \^stuff**
