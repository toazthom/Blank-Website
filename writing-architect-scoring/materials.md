# Test of Written Language	
Following the scoring rules in the manual, score the following subtests directly on the protocol:
-	Vocabulary
-	Punctuation
-	Spelling – capitalization errors count as spelling errors
-	Sentence Combining

Count any non-administered initial items as correct. 
Total the raw score for each subtest and record in the Excel file “TOWL scores”
If the section is blank, mark it as    in the excel file. 
Count the number of words written in the essay and record in column marked “number of spontaneous words.”

# Handwriting Paragraph Copy	
The students’ handwriting paragraph copy is located on the last page of the physical document (before the TOWL). Record the students’ handwriting paragraph copy results in the Excel file titled ‘TOWL scores.’

In dropbox, there is a pdf (Handwriting-paragraph copy) that lists the total number of characters. You can compare the student’s handwritten paragraph to that document. 

1.	Make sure all the words and punctuation marks are there. Ignore spacing issues.
2.	Circle any misspelled words and missing punctuation.
3.	Using the pdf, determine how many total characters the student wrote. 
4.	Subtract the number of missing and substituted characters (letters and punctuation) from the total.
5.	Report this number in the excel file titled “TOWL scores”
6.	If the page is blank, record “NA” in the excel file.
